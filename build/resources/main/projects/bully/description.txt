Bully Algorithm - Leader Election

# Description

	This is a simulation for the bully leader election algorithm. The algorithm assumes the following properties:

		* The process can fail during the election.
		* Assumes reliable transmission.
		* Assumes synchrounous system.
		* Each process knows the id of the other process and can communicate with all them.
		* 3 messages: election, response (Ok) and coordinator.

# Simulation

	1 - When the simulation starts, each nodes start a election, in order to choose a leader for the group already in the beginning.
	2 - When a new node get in the group, this node starts a new election.
	3 - It's possible to disable a node, in order to test what happens when a leader becomes unreachable.
	4 - It's possible to encable a node, in order to test what happens when a old leader that was unreachable comes back.
