/**
 * A distribution model that distributes the nodes on a regular grid depending
 * on the geometric node collections rMax. It choses the postitions so that the
 * field is optimally covered by the nodes. This means that the grid distances
 * are sqrt(2)*rMax. This completely covers the area between the nodes as there
 * is no point between the four nodes having a distance to all the nodes that is
 * bigger than rMax. If there are nodes left after having a node on every grid
 * position the model distributes the other nodes randomly on the field.
