/**
 * Random Way Point Mobility Model
 * <p>
 * The node selects a random point in the simulation area and moves there with
 * constant speed. When arrived at the position, the node waits for a predefined
 * amount of time and then selects the next point to move to.
 * <p>
 * Both, the speed and the waiting time can be described using a random-number
 * generator that returns values according to a given distribution probability.
 * The distribions must be specified in the XML configuration file, and may look
 * as following:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &lt;RandomWayPoint&gt;
 * &nbsp; &lt;Speed distribution="Gaussian" mean="40" variance="10"/&gt;
 * &nbsp; &lt;WaitingTime distribution="Poisson" lambda="10"/&gt;
 * &lt;/RandomWayPoint&gt;
 * </pre>
 *
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> The speed is measured in distance-units per round, the waiting
 * time in rounds. For the speed, the absolute value of the sample produced by
 * the speed-distribution is used.
 * <p>
 * Note that with the random way point mobility model, nodes tend to gather in
 * the center of the deployment area. I.e. the node densitity changes over time,
 * even if you have an initial random placement of the nodes. To circumvent this
 * problem, consider using the random direction mobiltiy model.
 * <p>
 * Further implementation notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the waiting time expires between two rounds, the node continues
 * waiting until the next round starts.</li>
 * <li>If a node arrives at its destination between two rounds, it starts
 * waiting, but this time is not counted towards the waiting time.</li>
 * <li>This implementation assumes that all nodes move according to the same
 * speed and waiting time distributions (it stores the distribution generators
 * in static fields used by all instances).</li>
 * <li>If the node is moved (either through the gui or any other means) between
 * two successive calls to getNextPos(), this mobility model asks for a new
 * position to walk to.</li>
 * <li>This mobility model works for 2D as well as for 3D.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @see projects.defaultProject.models.mobilityModels.PerfectRWP For a perfect
 * random waypoint mobility model which ensures that the simulation only
 * performs in the stationary regime, starting from the first round.
