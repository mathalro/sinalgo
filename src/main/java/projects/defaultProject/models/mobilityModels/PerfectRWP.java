/**
 * Perfect simulation with random way point - this mobility model starts in the
 * stationary distribution of the RWP. Therefore, the initial placement of the
 * nodes is not considered and the nodes may start in the waiting phase or
 * mobility phase.
 * <p>
 * In order to obtain the stationary distribution, the following steps are
 * performed the very first time the node is asked to return its position, that
 * is, when the first round starts.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Each node picks two random (uniformely distributed) points p1 and p2 in
 * the deployment area.</li>
 * <li>We determine a sample of a waiting time (wt) and the time to move from p1
 * to p2 (mt).</li>
 * <li>We pick a random time f in the interval [0, wt+mt].</li>
 * <li>If f < wt, the node starts waiting for (wt - f) rounds. Its position is a
 * random point on the line p1-p2.</li>
 * <li>If f > wt, the node is placed to p1 + (p2 - p1)* a, where a = (f-wt)/mt,
 * which denotes the fraction of the distance p1-p2 already moved during time
 * (f-wt). In the following rounds, the node continues moving towards p2.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> This special step only happens in the first round. Afterwards,
 * the node moves just as with the normal random way point mobility model.
 * <p>
 * To use <code>PerfectRWP</code>, you may use any initial distribution model,
 * as the initial placement of the nodes is not considered.
 *
 * @see projects.defaultProject.models.mobilityModels.RandomWayPoint For any
 * further details of the implementation of the underlying random way point
 * mobility model.
