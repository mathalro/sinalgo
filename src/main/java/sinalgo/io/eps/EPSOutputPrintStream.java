/**
 * Implements a state machine to print eps commands to a file. It helps the user
 * to output a graph to an eps. Implements some basic macros, lets the user add
 * custom macros, handles the eps header and trailer and offers an interface to
 * easilly print lines, circles and arrows.
 * <p>
 * Note that this Stream is a state machine. So all the setings (like the width
 * of the lines) are used for all successive lines until you reset it.
 * <p>
 * Note that the eps coordinate system is not the same as the one used in the
 * framework. The (0/0) point in the framework is (according to the drawing
 * routines of swing and awt) in the left upper corner whereas in eps it is in
 * the left lower corner. This makes it necessary to mirror the y coordinates
 * according to the bounding box. When using the drawing methods provided by
 * this class the mirroring is done automatically. When you are writing your own
 * direct output to the file use the mirror-method to mirror the y coordinates
 * correctly.
