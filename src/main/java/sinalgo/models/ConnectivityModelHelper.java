/**
 * A helper class that helps you implement the connectivity model. This class
 * iterates over all possible neighbors of a given node and asks you for each
 * node pair whether the two nodes are connected.
 * <p>
 * A class that is used to update the Connections of a Node. This is a dummy
 * implementation. It can be overridden by specific Connectivity Models like the
 * UDG or others. <br>
 * The ConnectivityModelInterface requires only the method
 * <code>updateConnectsions(Node n)</code>. This implementation scans over all
 * neighbors of n and executes the method
 * <code>isConnected(Node n1, Node n2</code> for each node-pair. Therefore, we
 * suggest that you overwrite the isConnected method in your subclasses - if you
 * prefer this approach.
