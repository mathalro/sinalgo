/* TODO: base packet delivery on edge ID
 *  2) While a packet is being sent, there needs to be a check in every round that the edge it uses is
 *     still in use. If this is not the case, it must not be delivered. But as noted in point 1), it must
 *     remain there until the time it would have been delivered.
 *
 *     NOTE: This test must be well coordinated with the update of the connections due to mobility & co.
 *     Such that if a node has a connection to a neighbor, it can always send a message that arrives in the
 *     next round, and not the mobility can break up this connection and fail the message.
 *
 *     Actually, testing whether the edge was there all the time is quite easy! Store the edge in the header,
 *     then when the message arrives, test whether the edge still exists (and is the same object) => compare with ==.
